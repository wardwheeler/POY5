1- General requirements
*****************************************************************************

In order to compile POY, the minimal requirements are:

- Objective Caml version >= 3.10.0, which can be found in
  http://www.ocaml.org.

- An ISO 99 C compiler.

- The GNU Make toolbox (version 3.80).

- The zlib compression library (http://www.zlib.net).

- LAPACK (for likelihood analysis) (optional)

For the readline interface the readline library is needed, and for the ncurses
interface then ncurses is needed. If none of them is available, use the flat
interface. 

The last command should probably be run as superuser. Check the configuration
options with ./configure --help.


*****************************************************************************
2- Compiling POY for one processor
*****************************************************************************

To compile the program, first modify the relevant paths and options in config 
(there is a brief description on each group of options or you can see the
program's documentation), and then simply:

cd src/
./configure
make 
make install 

By default the compilation scripts will try to use the ncurses, then the
readline, then lastly the flat interface. You can manually specify this by the
following:

cd src/
./configure --enable-interface=flat
make
make install


*****************************************************************************
3- Compiling POY for parallel execution
*****************************************************************************

For parallel execution the flat interface is automatically set by default. You
also need MPI installed. To compile follow your MPI implementation
recommendations, but a typical compilation would be:

./configure --enable-interface=flat --enable-mpi CC=mpicc
make
make install

Windows machines do not come with mpicc and setting this can be ignored. The
configure script will guess that 1) the libraries are in the path and 2) that
they are named conventionally.


*****************************************************************************
4- Compiling POY for SWAMI, PISE, or web portals
*****************************************************************************

For SWAMI, PISE, or web portals that provide access to the basics of the
application, a non-interactive version with limited functionality is provided as
the poy_server application. To compile it for sequential or parallel execution,
use the instructions above with the flat or readline interface. Then do:

cd src/
make portal
make install_server

The program documentation is available in poy_server --help. The SWAMI xml
description is available in xml/swami.xml
