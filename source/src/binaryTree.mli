(*This binary tree module is a splay tree -- a balanced binary tree*)

(** binary tree type. could be empty leafnode, or a leaf, or a tree.
*   k is the type of middle-key, a is the type of leaf.
*   middle key is bigger than keys in its left subtree*)

    | Empty
    | Leaf of 'k * 'a

(** [just_a_leaf btree] returns true if the tree is a single non-empty leafnode*)

(** [just_an_empty_leaf btree] returns true if the tree is empty*)

val create_btree: 'k -> 'a -> ('k,'a) b_tree

(** [add_to_btree key leafnode btree print_f_for_key compare_f_for_leafnode] add
* leafnode with key to btree, return the new btree and a bool sign, true if the
* leafnode is new to the tree, or if we already have the same leafnode with same 
* key, false if the same leafnode with different key is in the tree. usually

* leafnode with key. Since we are dealing with a splay tree, we rotate the btree
* to make the node we visiting closer to the root. 
* print_f_for_key and print_f_for_node are the debug function
* to printout middle-key and leafnode. *)

* tree, with function f_for_node and pinrt_f_for_key, f_for_node work on each
