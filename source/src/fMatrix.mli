type m
(** Abstract type to hold scratch space for 64bit floating point values.
    Auto-expands; does not shrink. *)

(** The default instantiation; initial size is '20'. This is very small, but
    will instantly grow to a reasonable size when used first. *)

(** [print m] Print the contents of the matrix; used for debugging. **)

(** [freeall m i j] Clear the matrix. **)
