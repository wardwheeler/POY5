(** [get_matcharr_and_costmatrix] is the main function of this module. it take
* two sequences, set of parameters (min lcb ratio, min lcb length, etc) and a
* costmatrix between charactors as input, output two code array of matching
* blocks, a cost_mat between lcb blocks and non-lcb blocks, ali_mat is the cost
* and alignment sequence between lcb blocks.
* 
* NOTE: edit_cost is the total editing cost between lcb blocks (which is not
* included is cost_mat), full_cost_listlst is a little bit redundant here, for
* it contains the two code array, but it also has the begin and end point of
* each block. *)
