concorde.h is made by all head files inside ./INCLUDE
modify concorde.h before make is useless

I should modify config.h.in, but I'm lazy

if we run ./configure, config.h will be replaced.

what I disabled

in ./INCLUDE/config.h
HAVE_GETHOSTNAME CCSIGNAL_SIGACTION HAVE_SLEEP 

in ./INCLUDE/machdefs.h
include <sys/socket.h> ..... <sys/resource.h>
CC_NETREADY 


Here is some explanation 

On Linux, you would call getrusage and check the returned struct rusage's
ru_isrss member (integral unshared stack size).

From the MINGW site and its sourceforge site's tracking of patches, I see that
in May of 2008 there was some patching done around getrusage and it looks like
it's been generally supported for quite a while. You should check carefully for
any caveats in terms of how much of the typical Linux functionality is supported
by MinGW


Here is something about sys/resource.h missing under mingw
