 * Description and handling of different kinds of alphabets for the analysis of

 * Sequences are usually composed of nucleotides or aminoacides. Other kind of

    (** The returned list is in the inverse order of the stream. It is done like
        this because the sequences are loaded by prepending, so there is no need
        to hit the performance by keeping the order of the sequences being read.
        The boolean argument is used to issue error warnings (true) or not
        (false). *)

        specifies the polymorphic style according to the file format i) second argument is
        a boolean for whether or not it should respect the case of the alphabet,
        and ii) it doesn't consume the entire stream but returns one element at a
        time. The list of elements is returned because a small set of alphabet
        elements can be enclosed inside [{{}}] or [{()}]. *)
