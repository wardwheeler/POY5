(** Module to align and create medians for dynamic likelihood characters under a
    numbner of different criteras *)

(** {6 Types} Representation of different dynamic likelihood characters *)

type r  
(** r contins the sequence data representations; although this is kept abstract
    to allow optional compilation of likelihood **)

type t = { model  : FloatSequence.dyn_model;
            data  : r;
            codes : int array;
            code  : int;
            times : float * float; (* branch lengths of composition *)
            cost  : float; }
(** The type for dynamic likelihood characters; encompasses integerized
    likelihood, floating point alignment, maximum parsimonious likelihood and
    eventually, fixed state likelihood and maximum average likelihood. *)

(** {6 Basic Functions} Implemented in similar modules. *)

val alph : t -> Alphabet.a
(** return the alphabet for the dynamic likelihood characters. *)

val total_cost : t -> float
(** Return the loglikelihood of the sequence; priors are obtained from model in [t] *)

val prior : t -> float
(** Calculate the prior cost of the sequence [t] *)

val get_cm : t -> Cost_matrix.Two_D.m
(** Return the cost matrix used to align [t]; this will fail, as the dynamic
    likelihood charaters use a floating point alignment matrix not compatible
    with the Cost_matrix module *)

val model : t -> FloatSequence.dyn_model
(** Return the likelihood model for the characters *)

val code : t -> int
(** Return the code for the character sequence. *)

val get_codes : t -> int array
(** Return the array of codes for the character partitions. *)

val compare : t -> t -> bool
(** Compare the model and sequence data of two dynamic likelihood characters *)

val to_string : t -> string
(** Simple to_string function for the data-type t *)

val name_string : t -> string
(** Name of the cost function and that we are using dynamic likelihood *)

val cardinal : t -> int
(** The number of partitions in the character set *)

val make : Alphabet.a -> SeqCS.t -> MlModel.model -> t
(** Create the type t used in the module. MlModel contains information regarding
    the type of dynamic likelihood, the alphabet could be different (for
    example, mlModel stores the singular representation, where the code is the
    index, this is different then the bitset version which this alphabet would
    represent. *)

val encoding : (float, Bigarray.float64_elt, Bigarray.c_layout) Bigarray.Array1.t -> t -> float

val median : int -> t -> t -> float option -> float option -> t

val median_i : int -> t -> t -> float -> float -> t * float * float
(** [median c a b ta tb] find the median between [a] and [b] seperated by [ta]

(** [median c a b ta tb] find the median between [a], [b] and [c] seperated by
    [ta], [tb], and [tc] respectively. Not implemented. *)

    [a] and [b] respectively, updating parent [p]. *)

val readjust3 : t -> t -> t -> t -> float -> float -> float -> t
(** Finds the final states from a pseudo three-d alignment (by doing all
    pairwise alignments and finding the best final median. *)

val readjust3_opt : t -> t -> t -> t -> float -> float -> float
    -> bool * float * float * (float * float * float) * t
(** Optimization function of the branch lengths based on readjust3 above *)

val to_single : t -> t -> float -> float * float * t
(** [to_single p m t] Find the sequence for m as a sequence of assigned states,
